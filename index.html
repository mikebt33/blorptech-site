  <h2>About Blorp Tech</h2>
  <p>
    Blorp Tech is a U.S.-based software company focused on strengthening
    community resilience and emergency response through simplicity-first design.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our work is guided by the <strong>B.L.O.R.P. framework - Bridging Local Observations & Response Platform</strong>.
    During emergencies, the people closest to the problem often have the most valuable information,
    yet that information rarely reaches responders in a usable form.
  </p>

  <p>
    We build systems that bridge that gap, translating local, on-the-ground
    observations into clear, actionable operational awareness,
    without burdening users with complexity or requiring ideal conditions.
  </p>

  <h2>What We Build</h2>
  <p class="muted">
    We build lightweight, operational tools that work when traditional systems fall short.
  </p>

      <span class="chip">Flagship Product</span>
      <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">Disaster Help</h3>
      <p>
        A lightweight, real-time coordination app that enables communities to share critical information
        during disasters while providing responders with structured situational awareness.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        Civilians can request help, report hazards, and offer assistance through simple, location-based inputs.
        On the responder side, Disaster Help bridges community reporting with emergency operations systems,
        including compatibility with TAK environments.

      <span class="chip">New Capability</span>
      <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">LIT (Logistics Interior Tool)</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Rapid interior mapping and space availability reporting for non-standard facilities.</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        Designed for situations where buildings are repurposed quickly—such as surge medical sites,
        shelters, or temporary operations—when accurate floor plans don’t exist or aren’t available.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sketch a simple interior layout in minutes</li>
        <li>Mark which spaces are open, constrained, or unavailable</li>
        <li>See real-time availability at a glance</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="muted">
        LIT is not a CAD tool. It’s built for fast operational awareness under pressure.

  <h2>Who We Build For</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Local and rural emergency managers</li>
    <li>First responders and volunteer organizations</li>
    <li>Communities affected by disasters with limited connectivity</li>
    <li>Agencies seeking lightweight tools that complement existing systems</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Our Approach</h2>

  <h3>Radical Simplicity</h3>
  <p>
    Simplicity is not an aesthetic choice, it is an operational requirement.
    In emergencies, every unnecessary button, screen, or setting creates friction.
    We intentionally limit scope to what matters most so tools remain usable under stress.
  </p>

  <h3>Real-World Reliability</h3>
  <p>
    We build for reality and design for degraded conditions by default. Our systems are built to function
    in low-bandwidth, low-power, and high-stress environments.
    Features that cannot be relied upon in real-world conditions are intentionally excluded.
  </p>

  <h3>Human-Centered Design</h3>
  <p>
    We design for people, not systems. For civilians under stress,
    responders making rapid decisions, and volunteers coordinating with limited information.
    Our goal is technology that supports human judgment rather than competing with it.
  </p>

  <h3>Operational Clarity</h3>
  <p>
    When everything goes wrong at once, clarity becomes a lifeline.
    Our products transform fragmented information into simple,
    real-time understanding. The right data, in the right form, at the right moment.
  </p>

  <h2>Pilots & Demos</h2>
  <p>
    We offer pilots and demonstrations for agencies, organizations,
    and communities interested in evaluating Blorp Tech tools for real-world use.
