    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      Blorp Tech LLC is a U.S.-based software company developing applications that strengthen
      community resilience and emergency response. Our name comes from the
      <strong>B.L.O.R.P. framework — Bridging Local Observations & Response Platform</strong>,
      which guides how we design systems that connect community-reported information with
      emergency operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our flagship app, <strong>Disaster Help</strong>,
      enables people to share real-time hazard reports, requests for help, and offers of assistance
      during disasters.
    </p>
    <p>
      We focus on building technology that is clear, dependable, and easy to use — especially in
      high-stress, low-signal environments.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Approach</h2>

    <h3>Radical Simplicity</h3>
    <p>
      Simplicity isn’t a design choice, it’s a moral choice. In emergencies, every second counts.
      Every extra button, every hidden setting, every confusing screen steals precious time.
      We obsess over reducing friction until what remains feels effortless.
    </p>

    <h3>Real-World Reliability</h3>
    <p>
      We build for reality, not conference room demos. Our tools must operate in low-signal,
      low-power, low-bandwidth, high-stress environments. If a feature fails in the real world,
      it doesn’t exist.
    </p>

    <h3>Human-Centered Design</h3>
    <p>
      We design for people, not systems. For civilians under stress, for responders making rapid
      decisions, for volunteers doing their best with limited tools. We honor their courage by
      building technology that respects their time, attention, and humanity.
    </p>

    <h3>Operational Clarity</h3>
    <p>
      When everything goes wrong at once, clarity becomes a lifeline. Our products turn fragmented
      information into simple, real-time understanding. The right data, at the right moment, in the
      right form.
    </p>

    <h2>Disaster Help</h2>
    <p>
      Disaster Help is our flagship app — a simple, real-time tool that helps communities stay
      connected during emergencies. Users can request help, report hazards, and offer assistance,
      while responders gain immediate shared awareness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Disaster Help bridges civilian input with responder systems, including TAK, to improve
      operational coordination.
